# mod-treasure  

### üá®üáø [ƒåesk√° verze](README_CS.md)

## Description (EN)
- This module allows you to:

- Create 3 types of treasure chests (basic, rare, epic)

- Configure their respawn time and language (Czech/English)

- Add custom items to the loot with chance and quantity range (min-max)

- Manage chests with in-game commands

### Requirements
Before use, ensure that the database user from WorldDatabaseInfo (default acore) also has access to the new customs schema:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON customs.* TO 'acore'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚Äì Reserved IDs
The module uses custom **entry** and **loot entry** in the `gameobject_template` and `gameobject_loot_template` tables.  
Make sure these IDs are not already used by other content in `acore_world`:

- **Czech chest variants (`gameobject_template.entry`):**
  - `990200` ‚Äì Prost√° truhla s pokladem
  - `990201` ‚Äì Vz√°cn√° truhla s pokladem
  - `990202` ‚Äì Epick√° truhla s pokladem

- **English chest variants (`gameobject_template.entry`):**
  - `990210` ‚Äì Plain Treasure Chest
  - `990211` ‚Äì Rare Treasure Chest
  - `990212` ‚Äì Epic Treasure Chest

- **Loot entries (`gameobject_loot_template.Entry`):**
  - `990200` ‚Äì Basic loot
  - `990201` ‚Äì Rare loot
  - `990202` ‚Äì Epic loot

If your database already contains records with these IDs, adjust the numbers in the module and SQL to another free range.

**Notes:**
- On startup, the module **automatically creates any missing** records in `gameobject_loot_template` (a placeholder or based on `Treasure.DefaultItem.*` in `.conf`).  
  It **does not overwrite** existing loot (it uses *INSERT IGNORE*).  
  A separate SQL seed for loot is **not required**; if you still include one, keep it **idempotent** (no `DELETE`; use `INSERT IGNORE` / `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`).

- After the **first chest addition**, a **server restart** is required for them to appear in the world. Any further additions will be visible immediately.

- After **adding or editing loot** in a chest, a **server restart** is also required for the new content to start appearing.

- Optional SQL `sql/optional/world/base/sack_loot_edit.sql` **modifies the loot of the original items**  
  **Small Sack of Coins (11966)** and **Fat Sack of Coins (11937)** so that they no longer drop from regular coffers  
  and become exclusive to the treasure chests created by this module.
